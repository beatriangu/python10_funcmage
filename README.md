# 🧙 Python Module 10 — FuncMage  
### Mastering Functional Programming in Python

**Author:** Bea  
**Python Version:** 3.10+  
**Standard:** flake8 compliant  

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

FuncMage explores the ancient arts of **functional programming in Python**.

In this module, functions become first-class citizens:

- Passed as arguments
- Returned from other functions
- Stored in variables
- Wrapped and transformed dynamically

The objective is not just to write working code,  
but to understand **why functional patterns improve composability and clarity**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

This module covers:

- Lambda expressions
- Higher-order functions
- Closures and lexical scoping
- `functools` utilities (`reduce`, `partial`, `lru_cache`, `singledispatch`)
- Decorators
- `@staticmethod`
- Functional purity (no global state)

## 🗂️ Project Structure


ex0/ → Lambda Sanctum (anonymous functions)
ex1/ → Higher Realm (higher-order functions)
ex2/ → Memory Depths (closures & lexical scoping)
ex3/ → Ancient Library (functools mastery)
ex4/ → Master’s Tower (decorators & static methods)


Each exercise focuses on demonstrating functional programming patterns clearly and cleanly.

## ⚙️ Technical Constraints

According to the subject:

- Python 3.10+
- flake8 compliant
- Use type hints
- Handle exceptions gracefully
- No external libraries
- No file I/O
- No global variables
- Focus on in-memory functional transformations :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Authorized modules include:

- `functools`
- `typing`
- `operator`
- `itertools`

---

## 🧩 Learning Goals

By completing this module, I can:

- Treat functions as first-class objects
- Build reusable abstractions through composition
- Implement closures that preserve state without globals
- Design decorator factories
- Use memoization for performance optimization
- Separate concerns using functional wrappers

---

## 🚀 Functional Philosophy

Functional programming encourages:

- Predictable behavior
- Reduced side effects
- High composability
- Clear separation of concerns

A Function Mage does not mutate recklessly.  
A Function Mage composes.

---

## 🔎 Evaluation Focus

During peer review, the emphasis is on:

- Explaining closures clearly
- Demonstrating how decorators wrap functions
- Justifying design decisions
- Understanding *why* functional patterns are powerful

This project is about conceptual mastery, not over-engineering.
